<h3><a href='http://www.mariosanchez.org/book/quiet/'> Quiet</a> </h3>

<p><img src="/images/quiet.jpg" width="100px"></p>

<p>Being an introvert myself this book really resonated with me. It talks about the current social obsession with extroversion and teamwork, especially in the business world, where being gregarious is seen as an almost indispensable precondition for success.</p>

<h3><a href='http://www.mariosanchez.org/book/mts/'> Made To Stick</a> </h3>

<p><img src="/images/mts.jpg" width="100px"></p>

<p>Many good ideas don&rsquo;t get the attention they deserve simply because they are communicated poorly. In Made To Stick the Heath brothers research and discover that all good ideas share some key similarities, and that they are successful by design rather than by accident.</p>

<h3><a href='http://www.mariosanchez.org/book/pmba/'> The Personal MBA</a> </h3>

<p><img src="/images/pmba.jpg" width="100px"></p>

<p>Outstanding. I was completely blown away by this book. It starts as a compelling case against spending a small fortune attending business school, and offering an alternative path: anybody can get a quality business education without mortgaging our lives by reading the right books and applying the concepts in real life.</p>

<p>It then lays out a comprehensive overview of every single business fundamental, concept and function.</p>

<p>To complement the book, the author has curated a list of <a href="https://personalmba.com/best-business-books/">99 must-read business books</a> so the reader can delve deeper into the different business subjects. Make sure to check the book&rsquo;s website, where you will find concise outlines of each of the chapters.</p>

<h3><a href='http://www.mariosanchez.org/book/ikigai/'> Ikigai</a> </h3>

<p><img src="/images/ikigai.jpg"></p>

<p>Sebastian Marshall is a bright, self-taught young strategist determined to leave his mark in the world. Drawing heavily from history and the careful study of classic and current business books, he offers insightful advice on strategy, productivity and business in general.</p>

<p>The book was put together in a week (mostly from blog content) as a dare to an old-school publisher who had offered to publish it but had been dragging the project for months. As a result, some passages may sound repetitive and there are several grammatical and spelling errors, but don&rsquo;t get fooled: there is gold on those pages if you just can see beyond the rough surface.</p>

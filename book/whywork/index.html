<h1>Why Do We Work?</h1>






<p><img src="/images/whywork.jpg" width="100px"></p>

<p><a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/bschwar1/">Barry Schwartz</a> questions the idea that people only work for pay and urges us to design work organizations that give people discretion and autonomy, and the chance to do meaningful work.</p>

<p>You can save yourself reading through pages and pages of empirical evidence and research notes, and go straight to the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_way_we_think_about_work_is_broken?language=en">author&rsquo;s TED talk</a> on the subject if you don&rsquo;t want to read the book.</p>

<h4 id="my-highlights-and-notes:938663226f49485894bf15c3c52c2d69">My highlights and notes</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Satisfied people do their work because they feel that they are in charge. Their workday offers them a measure of <em>autonomy and discretion</em>. And they use that autonomy and discretion to achieve a level of mastery or expertise. They learn new things, developing both as workers and as people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gallup found that only 13 percent of workers feel engaged by their jobs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<mark>The four characteristics of good work: challenge, engagement, meaning, and satisfaction. To this I would add <strong>autonomy and discretion</strong></mark>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Job crafting is what Wrzesniewski and her colleagues called when we shape our jobs with the central purpose of our employer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be satisfied with our work, we typically need a belief in the purpose of what we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is people who see their work as a &ldquo;calling&rdquo; who find it most satisfying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work &lt; Career &lt; Calling&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take discretion, engagement, and meaning out of work and people feel less &ldquo;called&rdquo; to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Virtually any job has the potential to offer people satisfaction. It can be made meaningful by connecting them to the welfare of others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Factors that effective organizations have in common</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Employment security.</li>
<li>Self-managed teams and decentralized decision-making.</li>
<li>They pay more than the market.</li>
<li>They provide extensive training.</li>
<li>They don&rsquo;t overmeasure employee performance.</li>
<li>They put great emphasis on the company mission.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;In short, you take discretion, engagement, and meaning out of work and people get less satisfaction from doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When people are in states of positive emotion, they think expansively and creatively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carrots and sticks. What is striking is that, in the analysis that Pfeffer offers, both of these tools have negative effects on employee engagement and work satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you create an environment in which workers are respected, they want to be there and they want to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carefully crafted incentive schemes, designed to ensure top performance, can often produce the opposite result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Social motives and financial ones compete. No incentives can ever be smart enough to substitute for people who do the right thing because it&rsquo;s the right thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we lose confidence that people have the will to do the right thing, and we turn to incentives, we find that we get what we pay for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &ldquo;watch where they walk, then pave it&rdquo; metaphor argues that the empirical data shape the theories people develop. The &ldquo;if you build it, they will come&rdquo; metaphor argues that theories shape data. [The author] defends the second metaphor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work over which people exercise some discretion and control leads to cognitive flexibility and to an engaged orientation to self and society; in contrast, excessively monitored, oppressively supervised working conditions lead to distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t think of themselves as primarily motivated by material incentives, but <mark>they think that pretty much everyone else is</mark>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;French emperor Napoleon termed ideologues were so in love with ideas that they ignored empirical evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better data and theories drive out worse ones, and progress is made. Why does this not happen in the case of theories about human nature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<mark>Theories about human nature can actually produce changes in how people behave</mark>. A theory that is false can become true simply by people believing it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Performance-oriented</strong> vs. <strong>Mastery-oriented</strong>: Performance-oriented people want to <em>prove</em> their ability while mastery-oriented people want to <em>improve</em> their ability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So is intelligence fixed? Partly, that depends on whether you believe it&rsquo;s fixed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless there is a collective effort to combat this ideology, we will all become the lazy, selfish pursuers of self-interest, not just in work but in our lives as a whole, that at least some social scientists have assumed we always were. So the question becomes: What can we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<mark>If we design workplaces that permit people to do work they value, we will be designing a human nature that values work</mark>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first step to taking responsibility over the structure of our workplace is to start asking questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the results of our transactions with customers positive sum, so that both sides leave the transaction better off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can demand of ourselves the effort to find the ways in which other people benefit if we do our jobs with enthusiasm rather than indifference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Industrialization has been a spectacular human achievement. But as it has relieved material poverty, it has done so at the price of poverty of spirit.&rdquo;</p>

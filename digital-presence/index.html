<h2>The Evolution Of My Digital Presence</h2>
    
<div class="date">February 19, 2015</div>




<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the Internet. The idea of having a publishing platform capable of instantly reaching anybody in the world, with no gatekeepers, for free, is still mind boggling to me. Today, of course, everybody has a digital presence, although for most people that means a profile in one or more of the ubiquitous social networks that have taken the Internet by storm.</p>

<p>When I talk about a having a digital presence, though, I&rsquo;m not talking about being a tenant in Zuck&rsquo;s massive apartment complex, but rather of building and owning our own digital home: a website that we can deploy using our own domain, designed and tweaked to our liking, and where we call the shots.</p>

<h3 id="the-early-days:97065e0991d562180917b8c3cd63a3c3">The Early Days</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a digital presence through self-deployed websites (mainly as a hobby) since the early 2000&rsquo;s. I started off by learning some basic HTML tags and hastily coding a website that I used to publish notes-to-self about search engine optimization, a topic I was deeply interested in back then. Then, Web 2.0 came along.</p>

<h3 id="the-wordpress-days:97065e0991d562180917b8c3cd63a3c3">The Wordpress Days</h3>

<p>Web 2.0 brought us content management systems (CMS) like Wordpress, with their arsenal of plug-ins, customization options and interactive features. I was curious, so around 2008 I created a self-hosted Wordpress blog where I posted short musings about branding.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take me long to figure out that Wordpress was overkill for what I really needed: a simple personal blog with no bells and whistles. That&rsquo;s when the simplicity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous">Posterous</a> won me over. Good things don&rsquo;t last forever, though, and some time after I switched Posterous sold out to Twitter and closed down. I had to take my posts and reluctantly move back to Wordpress, learning a valuable lesson in the process: never host your website in somebody else&rsquo;s platform.</p>

<p>By that time, however, Wordpress had lost its luster. Its notorious security vulnerabilities meant that I was spending less time writing, and more time weeding out blog comment spam and upgrading to newer versions of the software. Not fun. The straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back was when someone hacked into my account and started sending mass email spam. I immediately deleted my blog and removed the WP installation from my hosting account.</p>

<p>A few months after I obliterated my Wordpress site, I ran into a web design tutorial written by <a href="http://www.evbogue.com">Ev Bogue</a> that re-acquainted me with the basics of creating web pages, and introduced me to the newer, much simpler iterations of HTML and CSS: HTML5 and CSS3. I got excited and decided to create a website from scratch, like in the early days. I diligently followed the instructions in the tutorial, tweaked a bit the basic style sheet and framework that Ev suggested, and a few days later my new plain vanilla HTML personal site was up.</p>

<p>While it felt great to finally have a site I could control, the problems were obvious: since it doesn&rsquo;t use any programming, a hand-coded HTML site needs you to create and update each page individually. If you ever want to change, say, the footer or the navigation menu, you have to do it in every single page. If your site has only three or four pages it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal, but if you start adding posts and your site grows it can become a real issue. There had to be a better way, and that way is to use a <a href="http://www.mattweldon.com/static-websites-have-made-a-comeback/">static site generator</a>.</p>

<h3 id="blogging-like-a-hacker-static-site-generators:97065e0991d562180917b8c3cd63a3c3">Blogging Like A Hacker: Static Site Generators</h3>

<p>A static site generator is basically a program that takes your content and merges it with predefined templates that determine the layout and the look and feel of your pages, and then spits out your site as a bunch of HTML files. Depending on how you configure it, the program can create a blog post list for you, add new posts to that list, and update all your pages whenever you make a change to a common element of your site (like the navigation menu, footer, or sidebar)-all done automatically.</p>

<p>While using a static site generator is extremely easy, setting one up can be a royal pain for non-programmers like me. I definitely wanted to go this route, though, so I focused on acquiring the skills and tools to make it happen. The process took some time, some sweat equity, quite a bit of reading and plenty of trial and error, but in the end I succeded.</p>

<p>The static site generator I&rsquo;m currently using is <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, although there are literally <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net/">hundreds</a> that you can choose from.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As of March 30, 2015 I am not using Jekyll any more. I have switched to <a href="http://www.gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-tools-of-the-trade:97065e0991d562180917b8c3cd63a3c3">The Tools of the Trade</h3>

<p>In order to deploy a static site generator I had to learn a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> to write blog posts and content in general (easy);</li>
<li><a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML and CSS</a> to tweak the look and feel of the site (HTML, easy; CSS a little harder);</li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Git</a> to record changes to the site and communicate with my web hosting server (hard to wrap your head around the concept, but not that difficult once you &ldquo;get it&rdquo;); and</li>
<li><a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf">Linux-style command line essentials</a> to install the required software and to move quickly around my hard drive folders (easy).</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from that, I had to download the following programs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">Git for Windows</a> to version control my site and access a command line emmulator called Git Bash;</li>
<li>Ruby and Ruby&rsquo;s Dev Package, necessary to make Jekyll run;</li>
<li>Python, also needed to run Jekyll; and</li>
<li>The Jekyll and Github Pages gems: to generate the site and enable hosting in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/">This site</a> gives a very good overview of how to install Jekyll if you have a Windows box.</p>

<p>Finally, I opened an account with <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> to create the <a href="https://github.com/mariobox/mariobox.github.io">site&rsquo;s remote repository</a> (basically a backup copy of my website&rsquo;s files that Github uses to generate and serve my site to the public web). I also cloned an existing repository called <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now</a>, which provides a basic template for a Jekyll blog, so you don&rsquo;t have to start from scratch (you can later tweak it locally, in your computer, to make it look the way you want).</p>

<h3 id="next-steps:97065e0991d562180917b8c3cd63a3c3">Next Steps</h3>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s next? Perhaps tweak the look and feel of the site some more, creating sub-domains, deploying to a virtual private server (VPS), and installing a Linux operating system. Stay tuned.</p>

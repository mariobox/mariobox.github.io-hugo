      <title>So Good They Can&#39;t Ignore You</title>

&lt;p&gt;The career advice I wish I had received when I was 18 years old. This book exposes the &amp;ldquo;follow your passion&amp;rdquo; myth and argues that the best way to be successful and happy at work is to become extremely good at what we do. Read it before embarking on any significant career change or if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get more satisfaction out of your current job or career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are my notes and highlights from the book:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do some people end up loving what they do, while so many others fail at this goal? My question was clear: How do people end up loving what they do? And I needed an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom on career success—follow your passion—is seriously flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be good at something before you can expect a good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become, in the words of my favorite Steve Martin quote, “so good that they can’t ignore you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus away from finding the right work and toward working right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes time to get good at anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that’s the hardest phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many complex reasons for workplace satisfaction, but the reductive notion of matching your job to a pre-existing passion is not among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 4% percent of the total identified passions had any relation to work or education, with the remaining  percent describing hobby-style interests such as sports and art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a distinction between a job, a career, and a calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more experience [one has], the more likely [one is] to love his/her work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion Is a Side Effect of Mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three traits of a great job or career: Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling someone to “follow their passion” is not just an act of innocent optimism, but potentially the foundation for a career riddled with confusion and angst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craftsman mindset, a focus on what value you’re producing in your job, and the passion mindset, a focus on what value your job offers you [are opposites]. The craftsman mindset is the foundation for creating work you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Eventually] you are so experienced [that] there’s a confidence that comes out,” Steve Martin explained. “I think it’s something the audience smells.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obsessive focus on the quality of what you produce is the rule in professional music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craftsman mindset is crucial for building a career you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you focus only on what your work offers you, it makes you hyperaware of what you don’t like about it, leading to chronic unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deep questions driving the passion mindset—“Who am I?” and “What do I truly love?”—are essentially impossible to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two different ways people think about their working life. The first is the craftsman mindset, which focuses on what you can offer the world. The second is the passion mindset, which instead focuses on what the world can offer you. The craftsman mindset offers clarity, while the passion mindset offers a swamp of ambiguous and unanswerable questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t just envy the craftsman mindset, you should emulate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you’ll build a compelling career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopt the craftsman mindset first and then the passion follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic economic theory tells us that if you want something that’s both rare and valuable, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that if you want a great job, you need something of great value to offer in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three traits of great carrers: creativity, impact, and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital. The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of the passion mindset is that it strips away merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great work doesn’t just require great courage, but also skills of great (and real) value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISQUALIFIERS FOR APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carefully and persistently gather career capital. Valuable skills will translate into valuable opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on difficult activities, carefully chosen to stretch your abilities where they most need stretching and that provide immediate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Deliberate practice” is activity designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand the source of professional athletes’ talent, for example, look to their practice schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When experts exhibit their superior performance in public their behavior looks so effortless and natural that we are tempted to attribute it to special talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning is not done in isolation: You need to be constantly soliciting feedback from colleagues and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of these markets: winner-take-all and auction. Step 1: Decide What Capital Market You’re In. Step 2: Identify Your Capital Type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seek open gates—opportunities to build capital that are already open to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about skill acquisition like a freight train: Getting it started requires a huge application of effort, but changing its track once it’s moving is easy. In other words, it’s hard to start from scratch in a new field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Define good. Deliberate practice requires good goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Stretch and Destroy. Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “stretch” describes what deliberate practice feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not uncomfortable, then you’re probably stuck at an “acceptable level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Be Patient. Deliberate practice, an approach to work where you deliberately stretch your abilities beyond where you’re comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control over what you do, and how you do it, is one of the most powerful traits you can acquire when creating work you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;theory on how people end up loving what they do. I argued in Rule #1 that “follow your passion” is bad advice, as the vast majority of people don’t have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered and matched to a job. In Rule #2, I then countered that people with compelling careers instead start by getting good at something rare and valuable—building what I called “career capital”—and then cashing in this capital for the traits that make great work great. In this understanding, finding the right work pales in importance to working right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to acquire career capital. Your next step is to invest this capital in the traits that define great work. Control is one of the most important targets you can choose for this investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm alone is not rare and valuable and is therefore not worth much in terms of career capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have enough career capital to acquire more control in your working life, you have become valuable enough to your employer that they will fight your efforts to gain more autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When no one cares what you do with your working life, you probably don’t have enough career capital to do anything interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key, it seems, is to know when the time is right to become courageous in your career decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should only pursue a bid for more control if you have evidence that it’s something that people are willing to pay you for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do what people are willing to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to decisions affecting your core career, money remains an effective judge of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unifying mission to your working life can be a source of great satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have a mission is to have a unifying focus for your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missions are powerful because they focus your energy toward a useful goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systematically experiment with different proto-missions to seek out a direction worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mission chosen before you have relevant career capital is not likely to be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next big ideas in any field are found right beyond the current cutting edge, in the adjacent space that contains the possible new combinations of existing ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
We like to think of innovation as striking us in a stunning eureka moment, where you all at once change the way people see the world, leaping far ahead of our current understanding. I’m arguing that in reality, innovation is more systematic. We grind away to expand the cutting edge, opening up new problems in the adjacent possible to tackle and therefore expand the cutting edge some more, opening up more new problems, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough—it’s an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to identify a mission for your working life, therefore, you must first get to the cutting edge—the only place where these missions become visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First master a promising niche—a task that may take years—and only then turning her attention to seeking a mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who love their work got where they are by first building up career capital and then cashing it in for the types of traits that define great work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a mission, you need to first acquire capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancing to the cutting edge in a field is an act of “small” thinking, requiring you to focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time. Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and discover a mission in the adjacent possible, you must go after it with zeal: a “big” action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using small and achievable projects—little bets—to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a trusted strategy for making this leap from idea to execution, then like me and so many others, you’ll probably avoid the leap altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance, [successful people] make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of finding projects that satisfy the law of remarkability, which requires that an idea inspires people to remark about it, and is launched in a venue where such remarking is made easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent journalistic work about the biggest real estate deal ever made. If follows the saga of Stuyvesant Town, the largest residential project in New York City, from it&amp;rsquo;s humble beginnings as a middle class bastion in the late 1940s, to object of desire of financiers and speculators in the cusp of the real estate bubble of the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goes deep into the details of the deal itself and the personalities and egoes of the people involved. You will find this book thoroughly enjoyable if you are into real estate investing or politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating insider story about the culture of one of Wall Street&amp;rsquo;s most iconic institutions, through the eyes of somebody who went through all the motions until he decided it was time to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some critics have dismissed Smith&amp;rsquo;s account as oportunistic or naive, but the bottom line is that it sheds a powerful light on some of Wall Street&amp;rsquo;s worse practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Required reading for those who seek to understand corporate politics and how it can advance or hinder a business career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many good ideas don&amp;rsquo;t get the attention they deserve simply because they are communicated poorly. In Made To Stick the Heath brothers research and discover that all good ideas share some key similarities, and that they are successful by design rather than by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book will teach you how to make people care, pay attention, remember, and act on your ideas. Next time you stumble upon a great  communicator, you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize that they are applying  some or all of the techniques discussed in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work The System</title>
      <link>http://www.mariosanchez.org/book/systems/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.mariosanchez.org/book/systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.mariosanchez.org/images/wts.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100px&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground breaking book about the importance of implementing systems in your business and personal life. Well written, entertaining, rooted in a deeply personal story, the book deals not only with the why but also with the how of developing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1zpyqRi&#34;&gt;Work The System&lt;/a&gt; when it was highly recommended by two respected business thinkers that I follow online: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joshkaufman.net&#34;&gt;Josh Kaufman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sebastianmarshall.com&#34;&gt;Sebastian Marshall&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been very busy lately and a deep understanding of systems, standardization and automation will bring more control, less stress, and more time for value-adding activities like thinking, strategizing, and keeping healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint, and left me with plenty of actionable steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hereby summarize the main tenets of the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The systems of the world work perfectly 99.9% of the time:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyday systems like air travel or electricity delivery almost never fail. We&amp;rsquo;ve become so used to it that we have come to expect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Businesses are machines:&lt;/strong&gt; Like their mechanical counterparts, businesses have moving parts that operate in a linear 1-2-3 fashion. If a business sub-system is not working properly, we can isolate it, fix it and put everything back together, just like we would with a physical machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large corporations operate with systems.  Small businesses improvise:&lt;/strong&gt; The reason multi-billion dollar companies grow and expand is the relentless implementation of systems. For small business owners, though, systems implementation is low in the scale of priorities. Those who are able to take the leap and embrace systems thinking will be orders of magnitude more successful than those who don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are all project engineers. Our job is to create, fix and maintain systems:&lt;/strong&gt; This may come as a paradigm shift for most of us. By rethinking the way we work and redefining our role to project engineer (designing and repairing systems for a living) our productivity (and our sanity, I may add) will improve exponentially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;98% perfection:&lt;/strong&gt;  Borrowed from Pareto&amp;rsquo;s 80-20 rule, the author convincingly argues that 98% good is as well as perfect, since the remaining 2% would take too much time and effort for the benefit it would bring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Errors of omission:&lt;/strong&gt; Failures are not usually the consequence of overt mistakes but simply that somebody neglected or forgot something.  This is perhaps one of the most powerful arguments in favor of systems: if a process is thoroughly documented and followed, the chances of things going wrong will decrease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiet Courage:&lt;/strong&gt; Taking a cue from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/&#34;&gt;Steven Pressfield&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s books, the author urges us to beat the resistance by sticking to the plan no matter what, even when we don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it.  He calls this quality &amp;ldquo;quiet courage&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point of Sale Thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; An analogy to describe the  habit of doing things at once, by either doing them ourselves or delegating them. As in POS systems, where different business sub-systems are updated instantly the moment a sale is recorded, our habit of doing things at once will make a positive difference on our business in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singles and Doubles. Not Home Runs:&lt;/strong&gt; Superb results are not the consequence of genius or bursts of inspiration, but of small, deliberate and consistent incremental improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these concepts lead us to the most important part of the book: the introduction of the three essential documents. They are: the &lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objective&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Operating Principles&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Operating Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of these three life changing tools, the Operating Procedures, are what make the day to day of a business go flawlessly. They&amp;rsquo;re the detailed written instructions on how the different tasks and activities are to be performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Objective states what you aim for (your vision and long term goals), while the Operating Principles serve as a guideline for decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us internalize the concept, the author draws an interesting parallel between the three documents and the Declaration of Independence (the Strategic Objective), the Constitution (the Operating Principles) and the laws (the Operating Procedures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this book remarkable, aside from the usefulness of its content, is the deep personal connection between the author and the concepts he lays out. Sam Carpenter credits the systems mindset for rescuing him from near burnout and 80-hour workweeks, and leading him to a more relaxed, productive life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is also very well structured, half textbook/half biography, turning what would otherwise be a dry, tedious subject into an engaging read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rework</title>
      <link>http://www.mariosanchez.org/book/rework/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;One of the best business books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. The authors take every single piece of business conventional wisdom and shatters them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the books back cover says: ASAP is poison, underdo the competition, meetings are toxic, fire the workaholics, pick a fight, planning is guessing. All counterintuitive advice, but the authors will show you with facts that following it can lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some critics say that this book applies only to small businesses and start-ups, but I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in large companies almost all my life, and I find it&amp;rsquo;s tennets applicable no matter the size of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-highlights-and-notes:a3597fee00546c719f240d41842460c8&#34;&gt;My Highlights and Notes:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real world isn&amp;rsquo;t a place, it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse. It&amp;rsquo;s a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure is not a prerequisite for success. Evolution doesn&amp;rsquo;t linger on past failures, it&amp;rsquo;s always building upon what worked. So should you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can&amp;rsquo;t actually control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working without a plan may seem scary. But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with finding the right size and staying there? Small is not just a stepping-stone. Small is a great destination. Anyone who runs a business that&amp;rsquo;s sustainable and profitable, whether it&amp;rsquo;s big or small, should be proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Workaholics] try to make up for intellectual laziness with brute force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all you do is work, you&amp;rsquo;re unlikely to have sound judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your efforts need to feel valuable. You want your customers to say, &amp;ldquo;This makes my life better.&amp;rdquo; You want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do, people would notice. You should feel an urgency about this too. You don&amp;rsquo;t have
forever. This is your life&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re going to do something, do something that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to &lt;mark&gt;make something you want to use&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all, this &amp;ldquo;solve your own problem&amp;rdquo; approach lets you fall in love with what you&amp;rsquo;re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re new at something, you need to start creating. The most important thing is to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;When you want something bad enough, you make the time regardless of your other obligations&lt;/mark&gt;. The truth is most people just don&amp;rsquo;t want it bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect time never arrives. You&amp;rsquo;re always too young or old or busy or broke or something else. If you constantly fret about timing things perfectly, they&amp;rsquo;ll never happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind why you&amp;rsquo;re doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. &lt;mark&gt;Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But &lt;mark&gt;when you stand for something, decisions are obvious&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a world of difference between truly standing for something and having a mission statement that says you stand for something. Standing for something isn&amp;rsquo;t just about writing it down. It&amp;rsquo;s about believing it and living it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what kind of business you&amp;rsquo;re starting, take on as little outside cash as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll need to go the bigger, more expensive route, but not right now. Great companies start in garages all the time. Yours can too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is every business, new or old, is governed by the same set of market forces and economic rules. Revenue in, expenses out. Turn a profit or wind up gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business without a path to profit isn&amp;rsquo;t a business, it&amp;rsquo;s a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy. You should be thinking about how to make your project grow and succeed, not how you&amp;rsquo;re going to jump ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embrace the idea of having less mass. Right now, you&amp;rsquo;re the smallest, the leanest, and the fastest you&amp;rsquo;ll ever be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time/money/people/experience.&amp;rdquo; Stop whining. Less is a good thing. Constraints are advantages in disguise. Limited resources force you to make do with what you&amp;rsquo;ve got. There&amp;rsquo;s no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re better off with a kick-ass half than a half-assed whole. Lots of things get better as they get shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to great starts by cutting out stuff that&amp;rsquo;s merely good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So figure out your epicenter. Which part of your equation can&amp;rsquo;t be removed? If you can continue to get by without this thing or that thing, then those things aren&amp;rsquo;t the epicenter. When you find it, you&amp;rsquo;ll know. Then focus all your
energy on making it the best it can be. Everything else you do depends on that foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore the details for a while. Nail the basics first and worry about the specifics later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you can, &lt;mark&gt;swap &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s think about it&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s decide on it.&lt;/mark&gt;&amp;rdquo; Commit to making decisions. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions are progress. Each one you make is a brick in your foundation. You can&amp;rsquo;t build on top of &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll decide later,&amp;rdquo; but you can build on top of &amp;ldquo;Done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long projects zap morale. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the stuff you leave out that matters. So constantly look for things to remove, simplify, and streamline. Be a curator. Stick to what&amp;rsquo;s truly essential. Pare things down until you&amp;rsquo;re left with only the most important stuff. Then do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things aren&amp;rsquo;t working, the natural inclination is to throw more at the problem. More people, time, and money. All that ends up doing is making the problem bigger. The right way to go is the opposite direction: Cut back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start pushing back deadlines and increasing your budget, you&amp;rsquo;ll never stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of your business should be built around things that won&amp;rsquo;t change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now. Those are the things you should invest in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just don&amp;rsquo;t need the best gear in the world to be good. And you definitely don&amp;rsquo;t need it to get started. In business, too many people obsess over tools, software tricks, scaling issues, fancy office space, lavish furniture, and other frivolities instead of what really matters. And what really matters is how to actually get customers and make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make something, you always make something else. You can&amp;rsquo;t make just one thing. Everything has a by-product. Observant and creative business minds spot these by-products and see opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out? Funny how a question like that forces you to focus. You suddenly realize there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t need. And what you do need seems obvious. Build the necessities now, worry about the luxuries later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do everything you can to remove layers of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes abandoning what you&amp;rsquo;re working on is the right move, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve already put in a lot of effort. Don&amp;rsquo;t throw good time after bad work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interruption is not collaboration, it&amp;rsquo;s just interruption. And when you&amp;rsquo;re interrupted, you&amp;rsquo;re not getting work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems can usually be solved with simple, mundane solutions. That means there&amp;rsquo;s no glamorous work. You don&amp;rsquo;t get to show off your amazing skills. You just build something that gets the job done and then move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one likes to be stuck on an endless project with no finish line in sight. To keep your momentum and motivation up, get in the habit of accomplishing small victories along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you&amp;rsquo;re going to finish it&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to dedicate one day a week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm. Small victories let you celebrate and release good news. And you want a steady stream of good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already spent too much time on something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it, walk away. You can&amp;rsquo;t get that time back. The worst thing you can do now is waste even more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes people who are ten times more effective than the norm is not that they work ten times as hard; it&amp;rsquo;s that they use their creativity to come up with solutions that require one-tenth of the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reality never sticks to best-case scenarios. Note: Hope for the best. Plan for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates that stretch weeks, months, and years into the future are fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You&amp;rsquo;re probably still going to get it wrong, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you&amp;rsquo;re copying someone? If someone else is doing the bulk of the work, you&amp;rsquo;re copying. Be influenced, but don&amp;rsquo;t steal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it. &lt;mark&gt;Competitors can never copy the you in your product&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side. Being the anti-______ is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition. Instead of one-upping, try one-downing. Instead of outdoing, try underdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t shy away from the fact that your product or service does less. Highlight it. Be proud of it. Sell it as aggressively as competitors sell their extensive feature lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to build &amp;ldquo;the iPod killer&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the next Pokemon,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re already dead. You&amp;rsquo;re allowing the competition to set the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start getting into the habit of saying no, even to many of your best ideas. Use the power of no to get your priorities straight. You rarely regret saying no. But you often wind up regretting saying yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a few vocal customers happy isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it if it ruins the product for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be a jerk about saying no, though. Just be honest. If you&amp;rsquo;re not willing to yield to a customer request, be polite and explain why. People are surprisingly understanding when you take the time to explain your point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to make sure your product stays right for you. You&amp;rsquo;re the one who has to believe in it most. That way, you can say, &amp;ldquo;I think you&amp;rsquo;ll love it because I love it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies need to be true to a type of customer more than a specific individual customer with changing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have as many great ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don&amp;rsquo;t act in the heat of the moment. Write them down and park them for a few days. Then, evaluate their actual priority with a calm mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you do get bigger and more popular, you&amp;rsquo;re inevitably going to take fewer risks. When you&amp;rsquo;re a success, the pressure to maintain predictability and consistency builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach them. Teaching probably isn&amp;rsquo;t something your competitors are even thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying people&amp;rsquo;s attention with a magazine or online banner ad is one thing. Earning their loyalty by teaching them forms a whole different connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are curious about how things are made. It&amp;rsquo;s why they like factory tours or behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imperfections are real and people respond to real. It&amp;rsquo;s why we like real flowers that wilt, not perfect plastic ones that never change. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about how you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to sound and how you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to act. Show the world what you&amp;rsquo;re really like, warts and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call someone. Write a personal note. If you read a story about a similar company or product, contact the journalist who wrote it. Pitch her with some passion, some interest, some life. Do something meaningful. Be remarkable. Stand out. Be unforgettable. That&amp;rsquo;s how you&amp;rsquo;ll get the best coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Accounting is a department. Marketing isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/mark&gt;. Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing isn&amp;rsquo;t just a few individual events. It&amp;rsquo;s the sum total of everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never hire anyone to do a job until you&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do it yourself first. That way, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand the nature of the work. You&amp;rsquo;ll know what a job well done looks like. You&amp;rsquo;ll know how to write a realistic job description and which
questions to ask in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right time to hire is when there&amp;rsquo;s more work than you can handle for a sustained period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want a specific candidate who cares specifically about your company, your products, your customers, and your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you find these candidates? First step: Check the cover letter. In a cover letter, you get actual communication instead of a list of skills, verbs, and years of irrelevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. They don&amp;rsquo;t need heavy direction. They don&amp;rsquo;t need daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do: set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get
done, etc., but they do it by themselves and for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking&lt;/mark&gt;. Great writers know how to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is today&amp;rsquo;s currency for good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When something goes wrong, someone is going to tell the story. You&amp;rsquo;ll be better off if it&amp;rsquo;s you. Own the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s never really a great way to say you&amp;rsquo;re sorry, but there are plenty of terrible ways. One of the worst ways is the non-apology apology, which sounds like an apology but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really accept any blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you can&amp;rsquo;t apologize your way out of being an ass. Even the best apology won&amp;rsquo;t rescue you if you haven&amp;rsquo;t earned people&amp;rsquo;s trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don&amp;rsquo;t have a culture. &lt;mark&gt;Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut the crap and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that people are waiting to do great work. They just need to be given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility.Read more at location&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of nonthinkers. You create a boss-versus-worker relationship that screams, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t trust you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies are organizational scar tissue. They are codified overreactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again. They are collective punishment for the misdeeds of an individual. This is how bureaucracies are born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who said writing needs to be formal? Who said you have to strip away your personality when putting words on paper? Forget rules. Communicate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re writing, don&amp;rsquo;t think about all the people who may read your words. Think of one person. Then write for that one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASAP is inflationary. It devalues any request that doesn&amp;rsquo;t say ASAP. Before you know it, the only way to get anything done is by putting the ASAP sticker on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserve your use of emergency language for true emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have ideas. Ideas are immortal. They last forever. What doesn&amp;rsquo;t last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It has an expiration date. If you want to do something, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to do it now.&lt;/p&gt;

<h1>About</h1>



<p><img src="http://mariosanchez.org/images/msc-rio.jpg" class="roundcorners"></p>

<p><a name="1"></a></p>

<p>My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I am a <strong>Miami-based marketing professional</strong>, industrial engineer and tech enthusiast.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in <a href="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg">Lima, Peru</a>. Equipped with a degree in <strong>Industrial Engineering</strong> and a couple of years of experience as an entrepreneur I moved to Miami in 1989, where I decided to pursue a career in marketing. I enrolled in the University of Miami on a merit scholarship and earned an <strong>MBA in marketing and international business</strong>.</p>

<p>Since then, I have developed  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/">my career</a> in large consumer goods companies doing business in the <strong>U.S. and Latin America</strong>.</p>

<p>Over that timeframe I have performed the following <strong>roles</strong>: sales, product management, brand management, channel management, and product development.</p>

<p>My <strong>core competencies</strong> are product strategy, product development and sourcing, product marketing, and international business from the marketing and sales side.</p>

<p>My engineering background helps me approach marketing from a <strong>numbers-oriented, process-driven perspective</strong>, where <mark>proper execution is as important as the strategy behind it</mark>.</p>
